    <h3>Preparation Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Toast the hawaij spice blend:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Toss all the spices except for the turmeric and bay leaves into a pan and toast for 2-3 mins on medium high until they become fragrant. Don't let them burn.
                    </li>
                <li>Once they are done toasting, grind them finely together using a coffee grinder and set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Now, take two tablespoons of the spice mix from earlier and set it aside for the rice. The remainder will be used to marinate the chicken.</li>
        <li>Mix the spice mix with turmeric and salt and add olive oil to create a paste. Slater this paste over the chicken and leave it to marinate for a few hours.</li>
        <li>
            Next, thinly slice the onions and add them to a pot with oil.
        </li>
        <li>Fry for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are golden brown, remove them and set them to drain on paper towels. But leave approximately a third of them in the pot so we can cook them with the rice.</li>
        <li>Now, we make the rice broth. Keep frying the onions in the oil, and add the spice blend and  dried lime into it. Pierce the dry lime with a knife a few times for added flavor releasage.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leaves and bring the water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Next, use a steaming rack in the same pot to steam the chicken over the spice water and cover it for 50 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is really tender, remove it from the pot and pace it on a baking sheet to broil for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, bloom the saffron by grinding them in a mortar and pestle and allowing it to sit for a minute in  bowl with 2 teaspoons of hot water.</li>
        <li>Now strain the broth that was used to steam the chicken. Reserve the liquid and measure it out 1.5 cups of broth to 1 cup of rice.</li>
        <li>
            Mix the turmeric, broth and bloomed saffron and rice to the pot and simmer covered until the rice is cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and leave it to sit undisturbed for 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Serving Instructions:</h3>
    <ul><li>Start by spooning a large bed of the rice onto the plate, garnish with fried onions almonds raisins, and put the chicken legs whole on top.</li></ul>
